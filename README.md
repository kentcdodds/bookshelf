      (available free on Egghead.io), or have the equivalent experience (147
      minutes)
- [ ] 👋 Watch my talk
      [Why React Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWsZcBiwgVE&list=PLV5CVI1eNcJgNqzNwcs4UKrlJdhfDjshf)
      (35 minutes)
- [ ] 👋 Go through my
      [Learn React Hooks Workshop](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops/hooks), or
      have the equivalent basic experience of using hooks. You should be
      experienced with `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.
- [ ] 👋 3️⃣ Go through my

      `useCallback`.
- [ ] 👋 4️⃣ Go through my
      [Testing React Apps Workshop](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops/testing-react-apps),
      [TestingJavaScript.com](https://testingjavascript.com), or have the
      equivalent experience testing React components with
      [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and
      [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react).

The more prepared you are for the workshop, the better it will go for you.

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v10 or greater
- [npm][npm] v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/bookshelf.git
cd bookshelf
npm run setup --silent
```

If you get any errors, please read through them and see if you can find out what
the problem is. If you can't work it out on your own then please [file an
issue][issue] and provide _all_ the output from the commands you ran (even if
it's a lot).

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/) application.

You can also open the production deployment:
[bookshelf.lol](https://bookshelf.lol).

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode. Read the output and
play around with it. The tests are there to help you reach the final version,
however _sometimes_ you can accomplish the task and the tests still fail if you
implement things differently than I do in my solution, so don't look to them as
a complete authority.

## Working through the exercises

To get started, run:

```shell
node go
```

This will allow you to choose which exercise you want to work on. From there,
open the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file and follow the instructions there.

If you'd like to work on an extra credit, but you want to skip the preceding
steps, you can run `node go` again:

```shell
node go
```

This will let you choose the next exercise or you can choose which part of the
exercise you'd like to work on. This will update your `exercise` files to the
correct version for you to work on that extra credit.

### Zoom (for remote workshops)

- Help us make this more human by keeping your video on if possible
- Keep microphone muted unless speaking
- Breakout rooms

### Exercises

The exercises are in different branches. Each branch changes the
`INSTRUCTIONS.md` file to contain instructions you need to complete the
exercise.

The purpose of the exercise is **not** for you to work through all the material.
It's intended to get your brain thinking about the right questions to ask me as
_I_ walk through the material.

### Helpful Emoji 🐨 💪 🏁 💰 💯 🦉 📜 💣 👨‍💼 🚨

Each exercise has comments in it to help you get through the exercise. These fun
emoji characters are here to help you.

- **Kody the Koala Bear** 🐨 will tell you when there's something specific you
  should do
- **Matthew the Muscle** 💪 will indicate what you're working with an exercise
- **Chuck the Checkered Flag** 🏁 will indicate that you're working with a final
  version
- **Marty the Money Bag** 💰 will give you specific tips (and sometimes code)
  along the way
- **Hannah the Hundred** 💯 will give you extra challenges you can do if you
  finish the exercises early.
- **Olivia the Owl** 🦉 will give you useful tidbits/best practice notes and a
  link for elaboration and feedback.
- **Dominic the Document** 📜 will give you links to useful documentation
- **Berry the Bomb** 💣 will be hanging around anywhere you need to blow stuff
  up (delete code)
- **Peter the Product Manager** 👨‍💼 helps us know what our users want
- **Alfred the Alert** 🚨 will occasionally show up in the test failures with
  potential explanations for why the tests are failing.

### Workflow

- Checkout the exercise branch
- Read through the `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Start exercise
- Go through every mentioned file and follow the instructions from the emoji
- We all come back together
- I go through the solution and answer questions
- Move on to the next exercise.
- Repeat.

### App Data Model

- User

  - id: string
  - username: string

- List Item

  - id: string
  - bookId: string
  - ownerId: string
  - rating: number (-1 is no rating, otherwise it's 1-5)
  - notes: string

  - finishDate: number (`Date.now()`)

> For convenience, our friendly backend engineers also return a `book` object on
> each list item which is the book it's associated to. Thanks backend folks!

> /me wishes we could use GraphQL

If your "database" gets out of whack, you can purge it via:

```javascript
window.__bookshelf.purgeUsers()
window.__bookshelf.purgeListItems()
```
