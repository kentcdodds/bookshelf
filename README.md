## Pre-Workshop Instructions/Requirements

In order for us to maximize our efforts during the workshop, please do the
following:

- [ ] Setup the project (follow the setup instructions below) (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Install and setup [Zoom](https://zoom.us) on the computer you will be
      using (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Watch [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://kcd.im/beginner-react)
      (available free on Egghead.io), or have the equivalent experience (77
      minutes)
- [ ] Watch my talk
      [Why React Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWsZcBiwgVE&list=PLV5CVI1eNcJgNqzNwcs4UKrlJdhfDjshf)
      (35 minutes)
- [ ] Go through my
      [Learn React Hooks Workshop](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops/hooks), or
      have the equivalent basic experience of using hooks. You should be
      experienced with `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.
- [ ] Go through my
      [Advanced React Hooks](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops/advanced-react-hooks),
      or have the equivalent basic experience of using advanced hooks. You
      should be experienced with `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, and
      `useCallback`.

The more prepared you are for the workshop, the better it will go for you.

## Workshop Outline

- Manage forms (login and registration form)
- Add authentication (auth-context)
- @reach/router (setup all routes)
- App State (List Items)
- Code-splitting (add code-splitting the authenticated and unauthenticated
  pages)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v8 or greater
- [yarn][yarn] v1 or greater (or [npm][npm] v6 or greater)

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
yarn --version # or npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

You should be able to work through the entire workshop in the browser. This is
actually the recommended approach as it requires absolutely no setup whatsoever.
Go to
[this codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kentcdodds/bookshelf/tree/master)
and you should be good to go.

[![Edit bookshelf](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kentcdodds/bookshelf/tree/master)

If you'd rather be able to work through the workshop on your own computer, then
follow the following instructions.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```shell
# If you were given instructions for a specific branch to use, then use this command
# git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> https://github.com/kentcdodds/bookshelf.git

# otherwise, this is fine:
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/bookshelf.git

# then do this:
cd bookshelf
npm run setup --silent
```

This may take a few minutes. If you get any errors, please read through them and
see if you can find out what the problem is. You may also want to look at
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting). If you can't work it out on your own then
please [file an issue][issue] and provide _all_ the output from the commands you
ran (even if it's a lot).

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application.

You can also open
[the deployment of the app on Netlify](https://the-react-bookshelf.netlify.com/).

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest) in watch mode. Read the
output and play around with it.

## Working through it

Read through [`OUTLINE.md`](./OUTLINE.md)

## Helpful Emoji 🐨 💰 💯 🦉 📜 💣 🚨

Each exercise has comments in it to help you get through the exercise. These fun
emoji characters are here to help you.

- **Kody the Koala Bear** 🐨 will tell you when there's something specific you
  should do
- **Marty the Money Bag** 💰 will give you specific tips (and sometimes code)
  along the way
- **Hannah the Hundred** 💯 will give you extra challenges you can do if you
  finish the exercises early.
- **Olivia the Owl** 🦉 will give you useful tidbits/best practice notes and a
  link for elaboration and feedback.
- **Dominic the Document** 📜 will give you links to useful documentation
- **Berry the Bomb** 💣 will be hanging around anywhere you need to blow stuff
  up (delete code)
- **Alfred the Alert 🚨** may occasionally show up in the test failures with
  potential explanations for why the tests are failing.

## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>"npm run setup" command not working</summary>

Here's what the setup script does. If it fails, try doing each of these things
individually yourself:

```
# verify your environment will work with the project
node ./scripts/verify

# install dependencies
npm install

# verify the project is ready to run
npm run lint
npm run test:coverage
npm run build
```

If any of those scripts fail, please try to work out what went wrong by the
error message you get. If you still can't work it out, feel free to [open an
issue][issue] with _all_ the output from that script. I will try to help if I
can.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  "Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached" when running
  tests
</summary>

Try increasing your system's file watchers limit:

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```
